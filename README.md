# assistive-technology
For the Software Engineering Project we are working with the Program of Assistive Technology of Puerto Rico [(PRATP)] (http://pratp.upr.edu/) to create a open source software for people with disabilities that only have one control point.

This software can provide control of the usage of an electronic device, preferably a computer or laptop, to a person who might have more difficulty accessing these devices.

- Mouse emulation through a simple interruptor.

Thi will be an open source project
